# Abstract

This file corresponds to a BioHackrXiv publication template for the Brazilian Reproducibility Network "No Budget Science Hack Week" Event. At the beginning of the file you can see the required metadata, remember that some data has been added as an example, you will have to modify as it fits. Your file must be named paper.md and your references file must be saved right next to the paper.md file and be named paper.bib. Please include URLs (e.g., web pages, GitHub pages, data repos) as part of the text but also as a proper reference (i.e., in your paper.bib file) so later mining references will be easier. If you are interested in making future text-mining processes easier, please include the paper.md and paper.bib as supplementary data (you will find the right place to add this information later in the document). Thanks for you interest in contributing with your submission to BioHackrXiv.

# Introduction or Background

BioHackrXiv is a preprint to report on works done during BioHackathons, CodeFests, Sprints, VoCamps or similar events and related to Life Sciences and Health Care domains. Articles in BioHackrXiv commonly report on-going work as a couple of days of hacking are commonly not enough to get the things fully done. However, hackathon reports should still show work that people can build upon.

One of the reasons behind BioHackathons and similar is sharing: ideas, data, designs, software, documentations and tutorials among others. We therefore kindly ask you to use CC-BY 4.0 license for your work [@creative_commons_cc-by_nodate].  We also encourage you to share your code on GitHub, with an open license whenever possible.

The people behind BioHackrXiv has participated on multiple BioHackathons organized by National Bioscience Database Center (NBDC) / Database Center for Life Science (DBCLS) in Japan and ELIXIR Europe. We decided to create BioHackrXiv preprint in order to make it easier for all to share and report on the work done at this sort of events. Of course, any hacking event is welcome to publish here, the more the merrier they say! And, if you want to go for a more formal peer-reviewed publication, you can always do so once your work is more mature [@katayama_dbcls_2010].

Add to this section a couple of paragraphs introducing the work done where you (partially) develop the work you are reporting here. 

Our templates use styles adding some space after paragraphs rather than indentation.

## Subsection level 2

Please keep sections to a maximum of three levels, even better if only two levels.

### Subsection level 3

Please keep sections to a maximum of three levels.

## Where to find templates to submit to BioHackrXiv

We use a Markdown template (actually, this Markdown file corresponds to our template) plus a PDF generator tool together with the corresponding instructions [@prins_biohackrxiv_2020]. Please have a look, what you should submit to BioHackrXiv is the generated PDF, not the source Markdown.


## Tables, figures and so on

Please remember to introduce tables (see Table 1) before they appear on the document. We recommend to center tables, formulas and figure but not the corresponding captions. Feel free to modify the table style as it better suits to your data.

Heading level	| Description	| Font size and style |
---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
Title	Article | title	| 18 point, bold |
1st-level heading	| First level subtitle	| 14 point, bold |
2nd-level heading	| Second level subtitle	| 12 point, bold | 
3rd-level heading	| Third level subtitle | 10 point, bold |
Normal |	Normal text |	10 point

Remember to introduce figures (see Figure 1) before they appear on the document.

# Other main section on your manuscript level 1

Feel free to use numbered lists or bullet points as you need.
* Item 1
* Item 2

# Discussion and/or Conclusion

We recommend to include some discussion or conclusion about your work. Feel free to modify the section title as it fits better to your manuscript.

# Future work

And maybe you want to add a sentence or two on how you plan to continue. Please keep reading to learn about citations and references.

For citations of references, we prefer the use of parenthesis, last name and year. If you use a citation manager, Elsevier – Harvard or American Psychological Association (APA) will work. If you are referencing web pages, software or so, please do so in the same way. Whenever possible, add authors and year. We have included a couple of citations along this document for you to get the idea. Please remember to always add DOI whenever available, if not possible, please provide alternative URLs. You will end up with an alphabetical order list by authors’ last name.

# Jupyter notebooks, GitHub repositories and data repositories

* Please add a list here
* Make sure you let us know which of these correspond to Jupyter notebooks. Although not supported yet, we plan to add features for them
* And remember, software and data need a license for them to be used by others, no license means no clear rules so nobody could legally use a non-licensed research object, whatever that object is
* Jupyter notebook. name, link, license
* Github repo. name, link, license
* Data repo. name, link, license

# Paper data sources

* Paper.md and paper.bib location: URL here

# Acknowledgements

Please always remember to acknowledge the BioHackathon, CodeFest, Sprint, VoCamp where you participated and (partially) developed the work you are reporting here. Remember to also include the link to the hacking event here.
