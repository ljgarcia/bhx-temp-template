    abstract = { The FAIR guiding principles aim to enhance the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability of digital resources such as data, for both humans and machines. The process of making data FAIR (“FAIRification”) can be described in multiple steps. In this paper, we describe a generic step-by-step FAIRification workflow to be performed in a multidisciplinary team guided by FAIR data stewards. The FAIRification workflow should be applicable to any type of data and has been developed and used for “Bring Your Own Data” (BYOD) workshops, as well as for the FAIRification of e.g., rare diseases resources. The steps are: 1) identify the FAIRification objective, 2) analyze data, 3) analyze metadata, 4) define semantic model for data (4a) and metadata (4b), 5) make data (5a) and metadata (5b) linkable, 6) host FAIR data, and 7) assess FAIR data. For each step we describe how the data are processed, what expertise is required, which procedures and tools can be used, and which FAIR principles they relate to. }

  abstract = {The value of any kind of data is greatly enhanced when it exists in a form that allows it to be integrated with other data. One approach to integration is through the annotation of multiple bodies of data using common controlled vocabularies or 'ontologies'. Unfortunately, the very success of this approach has led to a proliferation of ontologies, which itself creates obstacles to integration. The Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) consortium is pursuing a strategy to overcome this problem. Existing OBO ontologies, including the Gene Ontology, are undergoing coordinated reform, and new ontologies are being created on the basis of an evolving set of shared principles governing ontology development. The result is an expanding family of ontologies designed to be interoperable and logically well formed and to incorporate accurate representations of biological reality. We describe this OBO Foundry initiative and provide guidelines for those who might wish to become involved.},

	abstract = {Medical practitioners record the condition status of a patient through qualitative and quantitative observations. The measurement of vital signs and molecular parameters in the clinics gives a complementary description of abnormal phenotypes associated with the progression of a disease. The Clinical Measurement Ontology (CMO) is used to standardize annotations of these measurable traits. However, researchers have no way to describe how these quantitative traits relate to phenotype concepts in a machine-readable manner. Using the WHO clinical case report form standard for the COVID-19 pandemic, we modeled quantitative traits and developed OWL axioms to formally relate clinical measurement terms with anatomical, biomolecular entities and phenotypes annotated with the Uber-anatomy ontology (Uberon), Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) and the Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO) biomedical ontologies. The formal description of these relations allows interoperability between clinical and biological descriptions, and facilitates automated reasoning for analysis of patterns over quantitative and qualitative biomedical observations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding was received for this work, and the authors received no payment or services from a third party.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:No ethical approval was required for this researchAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

It will be applied to several fields of medicine, biomedicine, and biology, and a number of applications are carried out in collaboration with the Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and the Coordination Center for Clinical Trials at the University of Leipzig. The General Formal Ontology (GFO) is a component of the Integrated System of Foundational Ontologies (ISFO), and ISFO is a part of the Integrated Framework for the Development and Application of Ontologies (IFDAO). The predecessor of IFDAO was the GOL project which was launched in 1999 as a collaborative research effort of the Institute of Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology (IMISE) and the Institute of Informatics (IfI) at the University of Leipzig.",
